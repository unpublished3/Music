# Music

Originally started as a music app that I could use with a consistent interface on platforms I use (linux, windows and android). Overtime as the project got more complex I started to focus mostly on the android app and the others got left behind. For now, works and works well (at least I think so) only on android. I might come back to this project in the future but this is all for now.
